# plugins_directory
This extension locates the SketchUp plugins folder and opens it.

It works for SketchUp versions from 2015 to Current.

How to install:
1. download the plugins_directory.rb and the plugins_directory folder
2. locate the plugins folder (it will be the last time you do it manually, this extension serves exactly this purpose); you find it under C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 20XX\SketchUp\Plugins.
3. copy the file and folder of point 1 in the plugins folder.
